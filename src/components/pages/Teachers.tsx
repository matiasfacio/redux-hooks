      "<q>Learn the basics well and become a hero.</q><br /><br />I started dancing tango at the age of 16 in ARG (1995). In the year 2002 I moved to Buenos Aires where I became professional. I have danced and studied many of the known Tango styles. My style? It is my own style. Improvisation, musicality, analysis of the tango structure, styling and conexion are my strong points. Through a deep understanding of Tango as a whole, I will help you to develop your own style.",

I discovered tango more than 15 years ago and have since embraced it completely. Being a physiotherapist has given me the capacity to understand different tango body techniques, and helped me to develop a specific system of teaching using: easy exercises, easy movement, clear directives... âˆ‘I invite you to join me to take your first steps or to polish your technique in advanced level.",
